# Snail

![what's a good name for a graphics engine? Snail engine. Since there's a snail in your ear that does math so you can hear, this snail does math in the computer so you can see. That's the logic.](snail.png?raw=true)

An opengl renderer that aims to unify my previous [PBR](https://github.com/stereoknife/PBR) and [SSAO](https://github.com/stereoknife/SSAO) assignments from uni.
